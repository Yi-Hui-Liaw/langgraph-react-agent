## Introduction
A Supplier Researcher Agent is built using Watsonx.ai Agent Lab. This agent will allow you to research the suppliers for procuring Xtralife based on past supplier performance, procurement rules and customer reviews. In addition, the agent can perform web searches using the integrated Google tool within Watsonx.ai Agent Lab. For example, it can answer queries such as "What is the weather today?".
